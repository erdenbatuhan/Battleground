# Battleground
A game called Battleground.

-----------------------
What is Battleground??
-----------------------
- It is a Java-Based game.
- It is my first project.
- It is developed as a project for CS102(Object-Oriented Programming) course by me(Batuhan Erden) and my classmate(Emir Arditi).

----------------
Some notes!! :)
----------------
- Since it's my first project, the code isn't a clean code. (We haven't edited it because we wanted to leave it as it was)
  * Naming conventions are not that good
  * The code style is not that good
  * Functions are too long
  * There are too many repetitive lines
  * There are too many global variables
- There was a background music in the game but we decided to delete it. (Because it occupies too much space)
- Feel free to contact me!!
